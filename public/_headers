**2. Check if the `_headers` file is in the build output:**

After running `npm run build`, check if `_headers` exists in your `dist` or `build` folder. If it's not there, that's your problem.

**For Vite projects**, you need to put `_headers` in the `public` folder, and Vite will automatically copy it to `dist` during build.

**For Create React App**, put `_headers` in the `public` folder as well.

**3. Alternative: Create `public/_redirects` file:**

Sometimes Cloudflare needs both. Create `public/_redirects`:
```

/\* /index.html 200
